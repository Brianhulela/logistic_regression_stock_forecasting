This repository contains code for predicting stock market movements using logistic regression. The goal is to forecast whether the price of a stock will go "up" or "down" based on historical data and technical indicators.

### Key Features:
- Data collection from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
- Feature engineering with indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, and Volume.
- Logistic regression model for binary classification.
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Visualization of actual vs predicted stock price movements.
